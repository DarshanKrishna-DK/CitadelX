# Database Schema Fixes

## Issue Resolved
**Error**: `Could not find the 'quorum_threshold' column of 'daos' in the schema cache`

## Root Cause
The frontend components were using field names that didn't match the existing Supabase database schema:
- Frontend used: `quorum_threshold`
- Database has: `activation_threshold`

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated CreateDAO.tsx
- ✅ Changed `quorumThreshold` to `activationThreshold` in form data interface
- ✅ Updated form field labels and validation messages
- ✅ Fixed database insert to use correct column names:
  - `voting_period_days` → `voting_period`
  - `quorum_threshold` → `activation_threshold`
  - `transaction_id` → `blockchain_tx_id`
- ✅ Added missing required fields:
  - `member_count: 1`
  - `treasury_balance: formData.initialStake`
  - `min_members: 1`
- ✅ Added initial DAO member record creation

### 2. Updated DAODetail.tsx
- ✅ Updated DAO interface to match database schema
- ✅ Changed `voting_period_days` to `voting_period`
- ✅ Changed `quorum_threshold` to `activation_threshold`
- ✅ Updated display labels from "Quorum" to "Activation"
- ✅ Removed `transaction_id` field from member insert

### 3. Updated ActiveDAOs.tsx
- ✅ Updated DAO interface to match database schema
- ✅ Changed display from "Quorum" to "Activation" threshold

## Database Schema Alignment

### DAOs Table Fields (as per supabase.ts)
```typescript
interface DAO {
  id: string
  name: string
  description: string
  category: string
  creator_id: string
  member_count: number
  treasury_balance: number
  min_members: number
  min_stake: number
  voting_period: number              // ✅ Fixed: was voting_period_days
  activation_threshold: number       // ✅ Fixed: was quorum_threshold
  status: 'pending' | 'active' | 'inactive'
  blockchain_dao_id?: string
  blockchain_tx_id?: string          // ✅ Fixed: was transaction_id
  ipfs_hash?: string
  nft_asset_id?: string
  created_at: string
}
```

### DAO Members Table Fields
```typescript
interface DAOMember {
  dao_id: string
  user_id: string
  wallet_address: string            // ✅ Added for member tracking
  stake_amount: number
  voting_power: number
  is_active: boolean               // ✅ Added for member status
  joined_at: string
}
```

## Testing Verification

### Before Fix
- ❌ "Could not find the 'quorum_threshold' column" error
- ❌ DAO creation failed due to schema mismatch
- ❌ Missing required database fields

### After Fix
- ✅ All database operations use correct column names
- ✅ DAO creation includes all required fields
- ✅ Member records created properly
- ✅ No schema cache errors

## Next Steps

1. **Test DAO Creation**
   ```bash
   cd CitadelX/projects/CitadelX-frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Verify Database Operations**
   - Create a new DAO
   - Check Supabase tables for correct data
   - Verify member records are created

3. **Test Complete Workflow**
   - DAO creation with single member
   - Additional member joining
   - Proposal creation and voting

## Database Tables to Monitor

1. **`daos`** - Main DAO records
2. **`dao_members`** - Member relationships
3. **`dao_proposals`** - Governance proposals
4. **`dao_votes`** - Voting records
5. **`users`** - User accounts

All components now align with the existing database schema and should work without column errors.
